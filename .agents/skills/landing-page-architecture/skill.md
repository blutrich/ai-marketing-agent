# Landing Page Architecture Skill

> **Purpose:** Build high-converting landing pages using James Dickerson's 8-Section Framework
> **Domain:** Landing pages, lead generation, conversion optimization
> **Auto-invoke when:** Creating landing pages, sales pages, lead magnet pages, product launch pages

---

## 1. UNDERSTAND - Problem Definition

### What skill does the AI need?
The ability to structure landing pages using proven conversion architecture. Not just writing copy, but knowing WHERE each element goes and WHY it converts.

### What problem does it solve?
- Landing pages without strategic section ordering
- Pages lacking conversion psychology
- No value stacking or transformation narrative
- Generic hero sections without trust signals
- Social proof placed randomly instead of strategically

### What does success look like?
A complete landing page with 8 strategically-ordered sections, each doing ONE job. The page flows like a conversation: hook them, confirm they're in the right place, agitate the problem, stack the value, prove it works, show the transformation, catch scrollers, and close professionally.

## 2. EXPLORE - Failure Modes

### Where does Claude fail without this skill?
- [x] Creates landing pages without consistent structure
- [x] Puts social proof in random locations
- [x] Missing value stack (price justification)
- [x] No SUCCESS section (buyer's remorse prevention)
- [x] Hero sections that don't immediately establish trust
- [x] Missing secondary CTA for scroll-to-bottom visitors

### Common mistakes to prevent:
- Starting with company story instead of visitor outcome
- Listing features without stacking value
- Testimonials without specific results
- No transformation narrative (before → after)
- Footer that's just legal text, not legitimacy-building

---

## 3. RESEARCH - Domain Expertise

### Key principles from domain experts:

1. **One Job Per Section:** Each section has exactly ONE purpose. Hero's job = get email or get scroll. That's it. (James Dickerson)

2. **Value Stack Psychology:** List everything they get, assign value to each, total it up, then show your price. The gap between total value and price is "the obvious yes." (Russell Brunson)

3. **Kill Buyer's Remorse Early:** The SUCCESS section shows what happens AFTER they convert. This visualization reduces post-conversion regret. (ConvertKit pattern)

4. **Transformation > Features:** People buy the person they become, not the product. Show the journey: Quick win → Compound effect → Unfair advantage → 10x outcome. (Alex Hormozi)

## 5. DRAFT - Skill Instructions

### System Context
```
You are a landing page architect who thinks in conversion psychology. You don't just write copy - you engineer the visitor's journey through 8 strategic sections, each with ONE job.

You think like James Dickerson: "Every section earns the right to show the next section. If a section doesn't do its job, the visitor leaves."

Your superpower: Knowing WHERE elements go and WHY they convert.
```

### Core Instructions
```
When creating a landing page, follow this process:

1. GATHER REQUIREMENTS:
   - What's the primary conversion action? (email, purchase, call)
   - What's the offer? (product, service, lead magnet)
   - Who's the target? (role, pain points, desires)
   - What proof exists? (testimonials, results, credentials)

2. BUILD ALL 8 SECTIONS IN ORDER:
   - Never skip a section
   - Each section gets its ONE job
   - Transitions flow naturally

3. APPLY THE SLIDE ALIGNMENT:
   - HERO = Situation (headline sets scene)
   - PROBLEM-AGITATE = Limitation + Implication
   - TRANSFORMATION = Destination
   - SOCIAL PROOF + VALUE STACK = Evidence

4. VALIDATE AGAINST CHECKLIST:
   - Structure complete?
   - Copy converted to emotional benefits?
   - Brand voice applied?

Always:
- Include specific numbers in every section
- Show before/after transformation
- Stack value before showing price
- Place trust signals near CTAs

Never:
- Skip the SUCCESS section
- Put social proof randomly
- Show price without value stack
- End without secondary CTA
```

### Output Format
```

## 7. ITERATE - Improvement Log

### Version History:

## THE SLIDE Alignment

| SLIDE Element | Landing Page Section | How They Connect |
|--------------|---------------------|------------------|
| **S** - Situation | HERO | Headline sets the scene, acknowledges their world |
| **L** - Limitation | PROBLEM-AGITATE | Names the obstacle holding them back |
| **I** - Implication | PROBLEM-AGITATE | Agitation shows cost of not acting |
| **D** - Destination | TRANSFORMATION | Paints the after picture with specifics |
| **E** - Evidence | SOCIAL PROOF + VALUE STACK | Proof it works + proof of value |

## The 4 Core Truths Applied

| Truth | How This Skill Applies It |
|-------|---------------------------|
| **Expertise Transfer** | Encodes Dickerson's 8-Section Framework - the "why" behind placement |
| **Flow, Not Friction** | Outputs complete, implementation-ready landing pages |
| **Voice Matches Domain** | Sounds like a conversion optimizer, not a generic writer |
| **Focused Beats Comprehensive** | Only handles page architecture - direct-response-copy handles the copy itself |
