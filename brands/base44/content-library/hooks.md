## Result Hooks

### Revenue/Success
- "Built in 1 week. $1M ARR in 3 months."
- "30 days after hitting publish: $50K ARR."
- "They replaced a $350K Salesforce contract."

### Speed
- "What took months now takes hours."
- "From idea to live app in a day."
- "Shipped a full app before lunch."

---

## Story Hooks

### Transformation
- "[Name] tried developers for months. Then tried Base44."
- "Before Base44, all they had was a dream."
- "Last year: frustrated. This year: $1M ARR."

### Relatable
- "You know that app idea you've been sitting on?"
- "If you've ever waited months for a developer..."
- "Remember when building an app meant learning to code?"

---

## Announcement Hooks

### New Feature
- "Just shipped: [Feature]"
- "You asked for [thing]. It's live."
- "New this week:"

### Community
- "Our builders are wild."
- "9-year-old Mika just built an app on Base44."
- "[Number] apps shipped this week."

---

## Contrarian Hooks

### Challenge Assumptions
- "You don't need to code to build an app."
- "90% of my code was written by AI."
- "The $5 logo is still on the building."

---

## Platform-Specific

### LinkedIn (longer, professional)
- Start with result, then story
- "GiftMyBook built their entire platform in 1 week..."

### X (punchy, casual)
- One stat, one line
- "1 week to build. $1M ARR in 3 months. GiftMyBook."
