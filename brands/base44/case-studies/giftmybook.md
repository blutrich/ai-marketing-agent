## The Story

GiftMyBook had spent months working with developers trying to build their custom book gifting platform. They kept hitting dead ends—scope creep, missed deadlines, growing costs.

Then they turned to Base44.

In just one week, they had a working product. Three months later, they had reached $1M ARR and profitability.

## The Journey

1. **Before Base44**: Months of development, multiple developers, dead ends
2. **Discovery**: Found Base44 as an alternative
3. **Build Phase**: Complete app in 1 week
4. **Launch**: Went live immediately
5. **Growth**: $1M ARR in 3 months
