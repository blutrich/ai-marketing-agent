# LinkedIn Voice & Tone Guide

Reference for maintaining authentic voice in LinkedIn posts.

## Voice Principles

### Sound Like Yourself, Not LinkedIn

**The test**: Read your post out loud. Does it sound like you explaining something to a smart colleague over coffee? Or does it sound like "a LinkedIn post"?

If it's the latter, rewrite it.

**Too LinkedIn-y:**
> "I'm thrilled to share that after an incredible journey of growth and learning, I've discovered a game-changing framework that will transform how you think about AI implementation."

**Actually sounds human:**
> "We spent three months trying to make our RAG system work. Most of that time was wasted on the wrong problems. Here's what we missed."

### First Person, Direct, No Hedging

Write in first person. Be direct. Don't hedge with qualifiers.

**Hedged:**
> "It might be worth considering that perhaps the traditional approach to prompt engineering could potentially be somewhat less effective than some alternatives."

**Direct:**
> "Traditional prompt engineering wastes time. Here's what works better."

You can still acknowledge uncertainty when it's real - "I'm not sure this applies outside B2B" - but don't hedge for politeness.

### Show Expertise Through Specifics, Not Claims

**Claiming expertise:**
> "As a seasoned AI professional with years of experience in the space, I can tell you that..."

**Demonstrating expertise:**
> "After deploying 14 production RAG systems over the last two years, the pattern I see most often is..."

The specifics (14 systems, two years) do more than any credential claim.

## Tone Calibration

### Confident, Not Arrogant

**Arrogant:**
> "Most engineers get this wrong. Let me explain why I'm right."

**Confident:**
> "This is how I approach it. There are other valid approaches, but this one has worked consistently for us."

### Honest About Limitations

Don't pretend your experience is universal. Scope your claims.

**Overclaiming:**
> "This is the only way to build AI agents that work."

**Appropriately scoped:**
> "This worked for our B2B SaaS use case. I haven't tested it in other contexts."

### Genuine Enthusiasm, Not Performed Excitement

There's a difference between actually being excited about something and performing excitement for engagement.

**Performed:**
> "I'm SO EXCITED to announce this INCREDIBLE new feature!! This is HUGE!!"

**Genuine:**
> "This is the feature I've wanted for two years. It changes how I work daily."

## What Not to Do

### Buzzwords and Corporate Speak

Kill these words:
- Strategic / Results-oriented / Proven track record
- Synergy / Leverage / Value-add / ROI-focused
- Best-of-breed / Cutting-edge / Revolutionary / Disruptive
- Rockstar / Ninja / Guru / Thought leader
- Solutions (use "products" or "tools" instead)
- Ecosystem / Landscape / Space
- Move the needle / Circle back / Take offline

### Humble-Bragging

**The pattern**: Fake humility wrapped around a boast.

- "So humbled to be featured in Forbes..."
- "I never expected this little side project to hit $1M ARR..."
- "Honestly shocked that my post went viral..."
- "Just casually keynoting at TechCrunch, no big deal..."

**Better**: Either be direct about the accomplishment or don't mention it.
- "I'm speaking at TechCrunch next month about why most AI implementations fail. Here's a preview of what I'll cover."

### Condescension

- "For those who don't understand..."
- "Let me explain this simply..."
- "A lot of people don't realize..."
- "Most people get this wrong..."

Assume your audience is smart. Explain concepts when needed, but don't talk down.

### The Performative Vulnerability Pattern

There's a specific pattern that's become cliche:

1. Open with struggle/failure
2. Describe the difficult journey
3. Reveal current success
4. Tidy lesson

This structure is now recognized as a template. The "vulnerability" exists to make the success look better.

**The pattern:**
> "Two years ago, I was broke, sleeping on my friend's couch, wondering if I'd ever make it. I had failed at three startups. Everyone told me to give up. Today, I'm announcing our $10M Series A. The lesson? Never give up on your dreams."

The issue isn't sharing struggle - it's the formulaic contrast with success and the clean lesson.

**Better approach**: If you're sharing a failure, share it because the failure itself is instructive. Not as setup for a success story.

## Technical Content Balance

### Assume Intelligence, Not Knowledge

Your audience is smart but may not know your specific domain. Explain the "what" and "why," not just the "how."

**Too technical:**
> "We implemented a multi-head attention mechanism with rotary positional embeddings and achieved a 23% reduction in perplexity on our custom benchmark."

**Too dumbed down:**
> "We made the AI better at understanding things!"

**Right balance:**
> "We changed how our model processes long documents - instead of treating each chunk separately, we let the model 'remember' context from earlier sections. Result: 23% fewer hallucinations on our test set."

### Be Current

AI/tech moves fast. Before referencing specific tools or products:
- Verify they still exist and are maintained
- Check if there's a better current alternative
- Don't recommend deprecated approaches

## Finding Your Voice

Instead of copying phrases from this guide or any template, find your own patterns.

**Exercise**: Look at how you actually communicate about work:
- Review your Slack messages about technical problems
- Look at emails where you explained something complex
- Check your texts to friends about work stuff

Notice:
- What phrases do you actually use?
- How do you structure explanations?
- What's your natural rhythm?

Those patterns are your voice. Bring them to LinkedIn.

**Anti-exercise**: Don't memorize "good LinkedIn phrases" and insert them. That's how everyone ends up sounding the same.

## Quick Reference: Before You Post

Ask yourself:

1. **Would I say this out loud?** - Read it aloud. Does it sound like you?

2. **Where are the specifics?** - Can you point to dates, numbers, names, quotes?

3. **What's the mode?** - Are you telling a story, sharing an observation, teaching something, reacting to news, or asking a genuine question?

4. **Is there template residue?** - Any phrases that sound like they came from a "how to LinkedIn" guide?

5. **Does it end naturally?** - Or did you bolt on an engagement CTA?

If something feels off, it probably is. Rewrite until it sounds like you.
