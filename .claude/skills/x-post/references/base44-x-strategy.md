# Base44 X (Twitter) Strategy

## Audience
- Developers
- Indie hackers
- Technical builders
- Vibe coders

## Content Mix
| Type | % | Focus |
|------|---|-------|
| Playful/Fun Content | 30% | Games built on Base44, memes, community creations |
| Quick Updates | 25% | Short feature teasers, one-liners |
| Technical Showcases | 25% | NPM packages, developer-focused content |
| Reposts/Amplification | 20% | Founder content, team builds, community wins |

## X Voice (vs LinkedIn)
| Aspect | X/Twitter |
|--------|-----------|
| Length | Short, punchy |
| Tone | Casual-playful |
| Technical depth | Assumed knowledge |
| CTAs | Casual ("give it a shot") |
| Emojis | More freely |
| Memes/humor | Common |

## Format Standards
- Short, punchy posts
- Video clips (short form)
- Quote tweets for engagement
- @mentions of tools/packages used
- More line breaks than LinkedIn

## Account Structure
- **@Base44** (Company): Official announcements, reposts
- **@MS_BASE44** (Maor): Personal brand, success stories, vision
- **@Assaf__N** (Assaf): Fun builds, games, demos

## Technical Tool Mentions
When showcasing builds, tag relevant tools:
- @greensock (GSAP animations)
- @radix_ui (UI components)
- @PixiJS (graphics/games)
- Other NPM packages as relevant

**Purpose**: Reach developer audience through tool communities

## X-Specific Content Types

### Games/Fun Builds
- 8-bit style games for viral moments
- "Find The Zombies" style demos
- Ask community for level ideas
- "What should I build next??"

### Quick Announcements
```

```

### Technical Showcase
```

```

## Engagement Tactics
- Quote tweeting community content
- Asking for ideas ("What should I build next??")
- Tagging tools/packages used
- Replying to viral moments
- Thread format for longer announcements

## Same Story, Different Tone

**LinkedIn version:**
> I met Guy Manzur today, the founder of lunair.ai
> He built it solo on top of Base44 and fully bootstrapped.
> He scaled to $50k ARR just 30 days after hitting the publish button.

**X version:**
> I met Guy today, the founder of lunair ai
> He built it solo on top of Base44
> fully bootstrapped
> scaled to $50k ARR 30 days after hitting the publish button

Key differences:
- X: No last name
- X: More line breaks
- X: Slightly more casual
