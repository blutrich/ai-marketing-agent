# LinkedIn Mastery Playbook

> "LinkedIn is the last platform where organic reach actually works for B2B."

This playbook covers advanced LinkedIn strategies from Marketing Moonshots, focusing on founder marketing, employee advocacy, and content tactics that drive real business results.

## Core Principle: One Big Idea

The foundation of LinkedIn success is clarity. Every post, every profile, every piece of content should reinforce ONE big idea.

**The Test:** Can someone who just discovered you understand what you're about in 5 seconds?

**Examples of One Big Idea:**
- "I help B2B SaaS companies reduce churn by 40%"
- "Building the future of AI-powered customer support"
- "Founder sharing the real journey of scaling to $10M ARR"

**How to Find Yours:**
1. What problem do you solve better than anyone?
2. What would your best customers say you're known for?
3. What content do you consistently have opinions on?

## Strategy 1: Employee Advocacy (The Spoon-Feeding Method)

### The Problem
Most employee advocacy fails because:
- Employees don't know what to post
- They're afraid of saying the wrong thing
- Creating content feels like extra work

### The Solution: Spoon-Feed Everything

**Step 1: Create a Content Kit**
Prepare ready-to-use content for your team:
- Pre-written posts (2-3 options per announcement)
- Images/graphics already sized for LinkedIn
- Suggested hashtags
- Best times to post

**Step 2: Make It Embarrassingly Easy**
```
Hey team, we're launching [X] tomorrow!

Here are 3 posts you can copy-paste (or edit):

OPTION A (excited):
"Just shipped [feature]! Been working on this for months and I'm pumped to see it live. [Link]"

OPTION B (story-focused):
"Remember when [problem]? We just solved it. [Link]"

OPTION C (casual):
"This is cool - [brief description]. [Link]"

Pick your favorite, personalize if you want, and post anytime tomorrow!
```

**Step 3: Leverage the Job Title Hack**
For big launches, have everyone update their job titles:
- "Chief AI Officer" for AI launch
- "Meeting Liberation Specialist" for meeting product
- "Remote Work Revolutionary" for distributed work tool

50 employees = 50 job change notifications = massive organic reach

### Metrics to Track
- Number of employees posting (aim for 30%+)
- Total reach across employee networks
- Engagement on employee posts vs. company posts (usually 8x higher)

---

## Strategy 2: Founder Marketing

### Why Founder Content Wins
- Personal profiles get 10x the reach of company pages
- People follow people, not logos
- Authenticity beats polish on LinkedIn

### The Founder Content Mix

**40% - Journey Posts**
Share the real experience of building:
- Wins and losses
- Lessons learned
- Behind-the-scenes moments

```
Template:
"3 months ago, I almost [bad thing].
Here's what happened:
[Story]
The lesson: [Insight]
[Optional: tie to your company]"
```

**30% - Expertise Posts**
Establish authority in your domain:
- Hot takes on industry trends
- Frameworks you've developed
- Advice based on experience

```
Template:
"Unpopular opinion: [Contrarian view]
Here's why:
[3-5 bullet points]
[End with engaging question]"
```

**20% - Promotion Posts**
Yes, you can promote - but do it right:
- Focus on customer outcomes, not features
- Share customer stories
- Announce with context

```
Template:
"We just shipped [feature].
Here's the backstory:
[Why you built it]
[Customer problem it solves]
[Early results]
Link in comments"
```

**10% - Personal Posts**
Human moments that build connection:
- Personal milestones
- Values and beliefs
- Non-work interests (sparingly)

### Posting Cadence for Founders
- Minimum: 3x per week
- Optimal: 5x per week
- Best times: Tuesday-Thursday, 8-9am or 5-6pm local

---

## Strategy 3: Praise-Led Marketing

### The Concept
Instead of promoting yourself, publicly praise others. The praised person shares your praise, exposing you to their network.

### How It Works

**Step 1: Identify Targets**
People in your ICP or adjacent to it:
- Industry thought leaders
- Potential partners
- Happy customers
- Respected peers

**Step 2: Create Genuine Praise**
Write posts that:
- Are specific (not generic "great job!")
- Highlight what makes them unique
- Include their @ handle

**Step 3: The Formula**
```
"I've been following [@person]'s work on [topic], and [specific thing they did] is brilliant.

Here's why: [Your analysis of why it's good]

If you're interested in [topic], follow them."
```

### Why It Works
- The praised person almost always shares/comments
- You get exposed to their audience
- You build relationships with influential people
- It's genuine, not transactional

### Advanced: The Praise Campaign
For launches, systematically praise:
- 5 early adopters (they'll share your product)
- 3 industry voices (they'll share your praise)
- 2 partners (relationship building)

---

## Strategy 4: Screenshot Marketing

### The Concept
Turn conversations, data, and moments into shareable screenshot content.

### High-Performing Screenshot Types

**1. Customer Win Screenshots**
Screenshot customer messages praising your product:
```
Post format:
"This message made my week:
[Screenshot of customer praise]
Context: [Brief backstory]
[Optional: lesson learned]"
```

**2. Data Visualization Screenshots**
Turn metrics into visual stories:
```
Post format:
"This graph tells a story:
[Screenshot of impressive chart]
[Explain what it means]
[Why it matters]"
```

**3. Conversation Screenshots**
Turn interesting discussions into content:
```
Post format:
"Had this conversation yesterday:
[Screenshot of chat/email]
[Your take on it]
[Ask for others' opinions]"
```

**4. Process Screenshots**
Show your work:
```
Post format:
"Here's what building [feature] actually looked like:
[Screenshot of messy notes/whiteboard/Figma]
The reality of [activity] is never as clean as the final product."
```

### Screenshot Best Practices
- Highlight the key part (circle, arrow, or box)
- Ensure readability (zoom if needed)
- Remove sensitive information
- Add context in your caption

## Strategy 5: LinkedIn Algorithm Hacks

### What the Algorithm Rewards
1. **Dwell time** - People stopping to read
2. **Engagement in first hour** - Comments > reactions
3. **Conversation** - Back-and-forth in comments
4. **Native content** - No external links in main post

### Tactical Recommendations

**Hook Formulas That Work:**
- "Here's something nobody talks about:"
- "I was wrong about [thing]"
- "The hardest lesson of 2024:"
- "[X] changed how I think about [Y]"

**Formatting That Gets Read:**
- Short paragraphs (1-2 lines max)
- White space between ideas
- Strategic line breaks for emphasis
- Number lists (3-5 items)

**The Link-in-Comments Trick:**
Never put links in your main post. Instead:
```
"[Full post content]

(link in comments)"

Then immediately comment with your link.
```

**The Comment Strategy:**
1. Reply to every comment within first hour
2. Ask follow-up questions
3. Tag relevant people who should see the thread
4. Go back 4-6 hours later and engage again

## Strategy 6: Creative LinkedIn Tactics

### Funny Job Titles
Change your title to something memorable:
- "Chief Meeting Avoider" (for async tools)
- "Professional Overthinker" (for consultants)
- "AI Whisperer" (for AI companies)

Do this company-wide for launches.

### The Carousel Framework
Carousels get 3x the reach. Structure:
1. Slide 1: Hook/Promise (bold statement)
2. Slides 2-8: Content (one idea per slide)
3. Final slide: CTA + reminder of who you are

### The Poll Play
Polls get massive reach. Use them strategically:
- Ask questions relevant to your ICP
- Make answers reveal market insights
- Follow up with content based on results

```
Poll: "What's your biggest challenge with [topic]?"
A) Option 1
B) Option 2
C) Option 3
D) Other (comment!)
```

### The Document Post
PDF documents get high engagement:
- Slide decks perform well
- How-to guides
- Checklists
- Templates
