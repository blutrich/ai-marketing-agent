# Guerrilla Marketing & Moonshot Philosophy

> "The best marketing tactics have one thing in common: AI can't do any of them."

This playbook covers high-impact, low-budget guerrilla tactics and the Moonshot Philosophy from Marketing Moonshots - focused on asymmetric returns, 24-hour execution, and human-centric marketing that AI cannot replicate.

---

## The Moonshot Philosophy

### Core Principles

**1. 24-Hour Execution**
If you can't ship a tactic in 24 hours, it's too complicated.
- Complexity kills momentum
- Speed beats perfection
- Done beats perfect

**2. Asymmetric ROI**
Seek tactics where small effort creates massive results.
- $500 spend → $50,000 in earned media
- 1 hour of work → weeks of attention
- One conversation → a transformative partnership

**3. AI-Proof Marketing**
Focus on what machines cannot do:
- Genuine human relationships
- Physical presence
- Authentic weirdness
- Real vulnerability
- Intuitive judgment calls

### The Moonshot Test

Before executing any tactic, ask:
1. Can I do this in 24 hours? → If no, simplify
2. Is the upside 10x+ the effort? → If no, skip
3. Could AI replicate this? → If yes, it's not a moat

## Pattern Interrupts

### What Are Pattern Interrupts?

Moments that break expected patterns so dramatically that people MUST pay attention. They work because:
- The brain is wired to notice novelty
- Unexpected = memorable
- Weird = shareable

### Types of Pattern Interrupts

**1. Environmental Interrupts**
Unexpected presence in expected spaces:
- Billboards in weird locations
- Guerrilla signage
- Physical presence where competitors aren't

**2. Format Interrupts**
Using media in unexpected ways:
- Emails that look like internal forwards
- Ads that look like editorial
- Professional channels with unprofessional tone

**3. Scale Interrupts**
Making things absurdly large or small:
- Tiny business cards
- Giant installations
- Single-letter domain names

**4. Context Interrupts**
Placing things where they don't belong:
- Enterprise software with meme marketing
- Serious brands being playful
- Consumer tactics in B2B

## Guerrilla Tactics Playbook

### 1. Email to Billboard (The Loops Strategy)

**Concept:** Screenshot your email/digital product and put it on physical media.

**How Loops Did It:**
- Designed an email newsletter to look good as a screenshot
- Bought cheap billboard space
- Displayed the email screenshot with "As seen in your inbox"
- The physical presence validated the digital product

**Your Version:**
1. Design one piece of content to look good screenshotted
2. Find cheap billboard/poster space ($50-500)
3. Display the screenshot with witty copy
4. Photograph the billboard for social media (doubles the content)

**Cost:** $100-1000
**Potential Reach:** Local attention + viral social post + earned media

---

### 2. Event Hijacking ($500 vs $1M)

**Concept:** Get event attention without paying for sponsorship.

**The $1M Strategy (don't do this):**
- Official sponsorship
- Booth on the floor
- Logo on the materials
- Forgettable

**The $500 Strategy:**
- Host counter-event nearby (dinner, happy hour, party)
- Set up outside venue with memorable experience
- Send swag to attendees via hotel drops
- Intercept with better conversation than booths allow

**Case Study: Counter-Conference Party**
- Instead of $50K booth, spent $3K on private dinner
- Invited 30 decision-makers specifically
- More deals closed than from previous year's booth

**Execution Steps:**
1. Identify major industry event
2. Book venue nearby (rooftop bar, restaurant, unique space)
3. Invite target attendees 2-3 weeks before
4. Create memorable experience (theme, speaker, activity)
5. Follow up during the event
6. Don't sell - build relationships

### 3. The Accidental Email

**Concept:** Emails that appear to be mistakes generate extreme curiosity.

**Techniques:**

**The "Oops Wrong List":**
```
Subject: Fwd: quick thought

[Name] - saw this and thought of you

[Interesting content]

Wait, this was supposed to go to [colleague name]. Since you're
here though, you might actually find this useful...
```

**The "Leaked" Preview:**
```
Subject: INTERNAL: Draft for review

[Name] - don't share this yet, but wanted your eyes on it...

[Interesting content]

Oh no, this wasn't meant to go out yet. If you saw this...
we're announcing publicly next week.
```

**The Cliffhanger:**
```
Subject: Did you see this?

[One intriguing line that implies more context exists]

[No explanation - force curiosity click]
```

**Why It Works:**
- Pattern interrupt (not a typical marketing email)
- Curiosity gap (what weren't we supposed to see?)
- Authenticity signal (mistakes feel human)

---

### 4. The Phone Hotline Demo

**Concept:** Create a phone number people can call to experience your product.

**The Bland AI Example:**
- Rented billboard with phone number
- People called and talked to their AI
- The call WAS the demo
- 5% conversion rate from billboard

**Applications:**
- Voice AI → Call to hear it
- Customer service → Call to test support
- Entertainment → Call for experience
- Sales tool → Call to see pitch in action

**How to Set Up:**
1. Use Twilio or similar to create number
2. Connect to your product/demo
3. Create physical advertising (billboard, poster, flyer)
4. Track calls and conversions

**Cost:** $50-500/month for phone service + advertising
**Unique Value:** Zero-friction trial, memorable experience

---

### 5. Engineering-as-Marketing

**Concept:** Build free tools that attract your target audience.

**Classic Examples:**
| Tool | Company | Lead Gen Strategy |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| Website Grader | HubSpot | Grade site → show CRM value |
| Headline Analyzer | CoSchedule | Improve headlines → upsell tools |
| Email Subject Tester | Mailchimp | Test subjects → start account |

**The Mini-Tool Framework:**
1. Identify a pain point adjacent to your product
2. Build the simplest useful solution
3. Gate results behind email capture
4. Naturally transition to your paid product

**Ideas by Category:**

**SaaS:**
- ROI calculator
- Readiness assessment
- Competitor comparison tool
- Feature request voter

**E-commerce:**
- Product finder quiz
- Sizing tool
- Gift selector
- Price tracker

**B2B Services:**
- Budget estimator
- Qualification quiz
- Process audit tool
- Industry benchmark checker

**24-Hour Build Challenge:**
- Day 1: Build in Typeform/Spreadsheet/No-code
- Test with 10 people
- If it works, invest in proper build
- If it doesn't, you've lost one day

---

### 6. The Fake Job Title Blast

**Concept:** Coordinate company-wide LinkedIn title changes for visibility.

**Why It Works:**
- LinkedIn notifies your network when you change titles
- 50 employees = 50 notification blasts
- Unusual titles get clicked
- Cumulative reach can exceed paid campaigns

**Execution:**

**Step 1: Pick a Theme**
Match titles to your launch/announcement:
- AI Product → "Chief AI Whisperer," "Head of Human-Machine Relations"
- Meeting Tool → "Director of Meeting Liberation," "VP of Calendar Freedom"
- Security → "Guardian of Data Integrity," "Encryption Evangelist"

**Step 2: Coordinate Timing**
- Pick launch day
- Have everyone change titles within 2-hour window
- Creates surge of notifications

**Step 3: Track Results**
- LinkedIn profile views
- Connection requests
- Mentions and shares

**Cost:** Free
**Reach:** Potentially 10,000s of impressions
**Risk:** May seem gimmicky if overdone; use sparingly

---

### 7. The Niche Absurdity Play

**Concept:** Create absurdly specific landing pages for tiny audiences.

**Examples:**
- "The first CRM for left-handed dentists"
- "Project management for cats"
- "Accounting software for circus performers"

**Why It Works:**
- Absurdity is shareable
- SEO captures long-tail searches
- Shows personality
- Can legitimately serve niches if real need exists

**Execution:**
1. Identify your product's horizontal nature
2. List 20 absurd niches you could "serve"
3. Pick 3-5 that balance absurdity with plausibility
4. Create real landing pages
5. Share organically (don't oversell the joke)
6. Some will go viral; all build backlinks

---

### 8. The Visible Labor Signal

**Concept:** Show the work, not just the result.

**The Psychology:**
People value effort they can see. Showing process:
- Builds trust
- Creates investment
- Demonstrates care
- Generates content

**Tactics:**

**Build in Public:**
- Share progress screenshots
- Post messy early versions
- Document failures and pivots
- Let audience feel part of journey

**Show the Ingredients:**
- "Hand-selected by our team of 12"
- "Reviewed 500 applications to find these 10"
- "8 months of research went into this guide"
- "We interviewed 47 customers to learn..."

**Visible Quality Control:**
- "Before publishing, each article goes through 4 reviews"
- "Every product is tested by a real human before shipping"
- "Our support team reads every message within 10 minutes"

**Content Ideas:**
- "Making of" behind-the-scenes posts
- Process documentation
- Rejected versions alongside final
- Time-lapse of creation

---

### 9. The Competitor Intelligence Hack

**Concept:** Use public information to find competitor customers and winning tactics.

**Google Dorking for Leads:**
```
"[competitor] sucks" site:reddit.com
"looking for [competitor] alternative"
"switching from [competitor]"
"[competitor] vs" intitle:review
site:g2.com "[competitor]" "cons"
```

**Ad Library Intelligence:**
1. Go to Facebook Ad Library
2. Search for competitor
3. Sort by longest running
4. Longest running = working
5. Note: creative, copy, audience signals

**What to Look For:**
- Messaging that's been consistent (proven)
- Audience targeting signals
- Creative formats they've tested
- Landing pages they're driving to

**LinkedIn Intelligence:**
```
site:linkedin.com "[competitor]" "we use"
site:linkedin.com "[competitor]" "grateful for"
```

**Convert Intelligence to Action:**
- Target dissatisfied competitor users
- Adapt proven creative approaches
- Counter successful messaging
- Identify gaps in competitor marketing

---

### 10. The Mini-Game Launch

**Concept:** Turn launches into interactive experiences.

**Examples:**
- Wordle-style puzzle revealing new feature
- Interactive quiz leading to product reveal
- "Choose your own adventure" landing page
- Easter egg hunt across your site

**Why It Works:**
- Play is irresistible
- Completion creates investment
- Games are shareable
- Unusual format = pattern interrupt

**Simple Implementation:**
1. Use no-code tool (Outgrow, Involve.me, Typeform)
2. Create 5-10 step interactive experience
3. End with product reveal + CTA
4. Track completion rates

## Moonshot Execution Framework

### The 24-Hour Challenge

For any guerrilla tactic, ask: **What's the 24-hour version?**

| Full Idea | 24-Hour Version |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Build interactive tool | Create spreadsheet, share link |
| Host major event | Host 1-hour Zoom with 10 people |
| Launch podcast | Post one conversation on LinkedIn |
| Create video series | Record one Loom, share natively |
| Build community | Start group DM with 5 best customers |

### The Asymmetric ROI Checklist

Before executing, score 1-10:

| Factor | Question | Score |
|--------|----------|-------|
| Cost | How little does this cost? | /10 |
| Effort | How little effort required? | /10 |
| Upside | How large is max potential return? | /10 |
| Speed | How quickly can we execute? | /10 |
| Uniqueness | Has anyone done this before? | /10 |

**Total 40+:** Strong moonshot candidate
**Total 30-39:** Worth testing
**Total <30:** Probably too conventional

### The AI-Proof Test

For each tactic, ask: **Could AI do this?**

**AI CAN do:**
- Write copy variations
- Generate images
- Analyze data
- Personalize at scale
- Automate sequences

**AI CANNOT do:**
- Build genuine relationships
- Show up physically
- Make judgment calls about taste
- Create authentic weirdness
- Take real risks
- Be vulnerable

**If AI can do it, it's not a moat.**

## Guerrilla Mindset Principles

### 1. Constraints Are Features
Low budget forces creativity. Embrace limitations.

### 2. Speed > Polish
A weird idea shipped today beats a perfect campaign next quarter.

### 3. Measure in Stories
"Did this create a story someone would tell?" > "Did this hit our KPIs?"

### 4. Fail Small, Learn Fast
Run 10 tiny experiments rather than 1 big bet.

### 5. Human > Scale
One great relationship outperforms 1000 impressions.

### 6. Weird Is Memorable
Safe is forgettable. Unusual is shareable.

### 7. Give Before You Ask
Lead with value. Reciprocity follows.

## Templates

### Pattern Interrupt Email
```
Subject: This is probably not what you expected

[Name],

Most [industry] emails are boring. They talk about [common topic].

This isn't that.

[One surprising/interesting thing]

If that interests you: [simple CTA]
If not: totally cool, carry on!

[Name]
```

### Guerrilla Event Invite
```
Subject: Not the [Conference Name] party you expected

Hey [Name],

Everyone's going to the same panels and networking events.

We're doing something different:
[Event description]
[Date/Time/Location]
[20 people max]

No pitches. No sponsors. Just [value proposition].

Want in?
[Simple reply CTA]
```

### Build in Public Post

Week [X] of building [Product]:

What worked:
- [Specific win]
- [Specific win]

What didn't:

## The Ultimate Guerrilla Principle

> "The best marketing doesn't feel like marketing."

Every tactic here works because it:
- Surprises people
- Provides genuine value
- Creates real human connection
- Cannot be automated
- Tells a story worth sharing

That's the moonshot: tactics that work precisely because they're too human, too weird, and too risky for anyone else to try.
