# Product Hunt Dominance Playbook

> "Product Hunt isn't won on launch day - it's won in the 8 weeks before."

This playbook covers the complete strategy for dominating Product Hunt launches, based on tactics from Marketing Moonshots.

---

## The Reality of Product Hunt

### What Most People Get Wrong

1. **Thinking launch day is what matters**
   - By launch day, 80% of your outcome is determined
   - The community relationships you've built (or haven't) decide everything

2. **Focusing on the product, not the people**
   - PH is a community-driven platform
   - Your product matters less than your relationships

3. **Asking for upvotes cold**
   - This is spam and often backfires
   - Real support comes from real relationships

### What Actually Wins

- **Relationship density**: How many active PHunters know you?
- **Reciprocity debt**: How many people "owe" you?
- **Community standing**: Are you known as someone who gives?

## The 8-Week Protocol

### Overview

| Week | Focus | Daily Time |
|------|-------|------------|
| 1-2 | Research & List Building | 15 min |
| 3-4 | Initial Outreach & Engagement | 20 min |
| 5-6 | Deepening Relationships | 15 min |
| 7 | Pre-Launch Activation | 30 min |
| 8 | Launch Week | 60+ min |

---

## Weeks 1-2: Research & List Building

### Goal: Identify 200+ active Product Hunt community members

### Day-by-Day Tasks

**Days 1-3: Map the Community**
1. Study top launches from past 6 months
2. Note who hunted them, who made them
3. Identify repeat top performers (makers with multiple wins)
4. Save their PH profiles

**Days 4-7: Build Your Target List**
Create spreadsheet with columns:
- Name
- PH Username
- Twitter/X handle
- LinkedIn
- What they've launched/hunted
- Notes

**Days 8-14: Expand the List**
1. Follow top hunters and see who they follow
2. Check who actively comments on successful launches
3. Look at "top supporters" of recent launches
4. Add everyone with 200+ karma who's been active in last 30 days

### Target Categories

| Category | Why They Matter | # to Find |
|----------|-----------------|-----------|
| Prolific Hunters | Can hunt your product | 20 |
| Successful Makers | Know how to win, reciprocate | 50 |
| Active Commenters | Engaged community members | 100 |
| Rising Stars | Motivated to build reputation | 30+ |

### Research Output
By end of Week 2, you should have:
- 200+ names with contact info
- Notes on what each person cares about
- Prioritized list (A/B/C tier)

---

## Weeks 3-4: Initial Outreach & Engagement

### Goal: Make genuine contact with 50+ people

### The Engagement Strategy

**NOT THIS:**
> "Hey, I'm launching soon on PH. Can I count on your support?"

**INSTEAD:**
Start giving before asking. Build relationship equity.

### Daily 20-Minute Routine

**Minutes 0-10: Product Hunt Activity**
1. Browse homepage
2. Upvote 3-5 products you genuinely like
3. Leave 2-3 thoughtful comments
4. Follow 5 new interesting makers

**Minutes 10-20: Maker Outreach**
1. Find someone from your list who launched recently
2. Genuinely use/review their product
3. Send a DM with specific feedback

### The Initial DM Template

```
Hey [Name]!

Just saw [Product] - [specific thing you noticed/liked].

Quick question: [genuine question about their product/launch]

I'm building [one sentence about you], so learning a lot
from how others approach this.

Congrats on the launch!
```

### Engagement Types

**Highest Value:**
- Leave detailed, helpful comment on their launch
- Share their product on your social
- Write about their product in your newsletter

**Medium Value:**
- Upvote with comment
- Reply thoughtfully to their comments
- Engage with their tweets about the launch

**Baseline:**
- Upvote their product
- Follow them on PH
- React to their comments

### Tracking Template

```
| Name | First Contact | Value Given | Response | Follow-up |
|------|---------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| [x]  | [date]        | [what]      | [y/n]    | [date]    |
```

---

## Weeks 5-6: Deepening Relationships

### Goal: Convert connections into genuine relationships

### The Reciprocity Trap

**Concept:** Help makers when they're most vulnerable (during their launch). They'll feel obligated to return the favor.

**Tactical Execution:**
1. Watch for launches from your list
2. When someone launches, go ALL IN:
   - Be first to comment (thoughtful, substantive)
   - Share on all your social channels
   - Reply to others' comments on their launch
   - Send DM with support and offer to help

**The Post-Launch DM:**
```
Hey [Name]!

Congrats on [Product] launch! [Specific observation about
how it went]

Anything I can do to help amplify? Happy to:
- Share to my [X] followers
- Post in [relevant Slack/Discord]
- Write up a quick review

Just let me know!
```

### Daily 15-Minute Routine

**Minutes 0-7: Support Active Launches**
- Check if anyone from your list launched
- If yes: execute full support protocol
- If no: continue engagement from Weeks 3-4

**Minutes 7-15: Deepen Existing Connections**
- Reply to people who responded to earlier outreach
- Move conversations forward
- Offer specific help

### Relationship Levels

| Level | Description | Actions |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| 0 | Stranger | No contact yet |
| 1 | Acknowledged | They replied once |
| 2 | Recognized | Multiple exchanges |
| 3 | Relationship | Would help each other |
| 4 | Advocate | Actively promotes you |

**Goal:** Get 30+ people to Level 2-3 before launch

---

## Week 7: Pre-Launch Activation

### Goal: Warm up your network for launch day

### Day-by-Day

**Day 1-2: Finalize Launch Assets**
- Product ready (obviously)
- Landing page polished
- Launch copy written
- Images/video prepared

**Day 3-4: Soft Announcements**
Share on social (Twitter/X, LinkedIn):
```

```

**Day 5: Direct Outreach (Tier A contacts)**
DM your strongest 20 relationships:
```

Would mean a lot to have your support. No pressure
on upvoting - but would love if you could:
- Check it out when we go live
- Share if you genuinely find it interesting

I'll send you the link morning of!
```

**Day 6: Direct Outreach (Tier B contacts)**
Broader but still personal outreach to next 30-50 people.

**Day 7: Final Prep**

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Starting outreach too late**
   - 8 weeks is minimum; 12 is better

2. **Being transactional**
   - "Upvote for upvote" doesn't work
   - Build real relationships

3. **Ignoring comments**
   - Every unanswered comment hurts you
   - Responsiveness signals quality

4. **Wrong timing**
   - Launching Friday or weekend
   - Launching during major tech events

5. **Weak first comment**
   - Your maker comment sets the tone
   - Make it substantial and engaging

6. **Disappearing after launch**
   - Community remembers abandonment
   - Stay engaged for future launches
