# The I.D.E.A. Framework for Systematic Creativity

> "Creativity isn't magic - it's a system."

This framework from Marketing Moonshots turns idea generation from random brainstorming into a repeatable process: **Identify → Decode → Extract → Apply**

---

## Overview

| Stage | Action | Output |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **I**dentify | Find high-signal sources | List of interesting tactics/campaigns |
| **D**ecode | Reverse-engineer what works | Understanding of WHY it works |
| **E**xtract | Pull out generic ingredients | Reusable principles and patterns |
| **A**pply | Fuse with your assets | Tailored tactics for your situation |

---

## Stage 1: IDENTIFY - Finding High-Signal Sources

Not all inspiration is equal. Focus on high-signal sources where successful tactics concentrate.

### Top Sources to Monitor

**1. Google Alerts**
Set up alerts for:
- "[Competitor name] marketing"
- "[Industry] viral campaign"
- "[Industry] product launch"
- "fastest growing [your category]"

**2. Product Hunt**
Daily goldmine of tactics:
- Study top launches (what made them win?)
- Read maker comments (how did they prepare?)
- Note taglines that hook you
- Screenshot landing pages

**3. Hyper-Growth Companies**
Track companies growing 50%+ YoY:
- Ramp, Notion, Figma, Linear
- What are they doing differently?
- Follow their marketing leads on LinkedIn
- Use Wayback Machine to see evolution

**4. r/InternetIsBeautiful**
Surprisingly high-signal subreddit:
- Interactive experiences that go viral
- Mini-tools and calculators
- Unusual web experiences
- Note: what makes people share these?

**5. Ad Libraries**
- Facebook Ad Library (free)
- TikTok Creative Center
- Google Ads Transparency Center
- Look for: ads running 90+ days (proven winners)

**6. Marketing Case Study Sources**
- Marketing Examples (marketingexamples.com)
- Really Good Emails
- Swipe File collections
- Award show winners (Cannes Lions, Webby Awards)

### Your Identify Ritual

**Weekly (15 min):**
1. Check Google Alerts
2. Scan Product Hunt top 5
3. Save 3 interesting tactics to swipe file

**Monthly (30 min):**
1. Deep-dive one hyper-growth company
2. Review competitor ad libraries
3. Explore one new source

---

## Stage 2: DECODE - Reverse Engineering

Once you find something interesting, don't just admire it. Decode it.

### The Decoding Questions

**What problem does this solve?**
- What pain point does it address?
- What desire does it fulfill?
- What emotion does it trigger?

**Why did it spread?**
- What made people share it?
- What social currency does it provide?
- What story does it let people tell about themselves?

**What's the mechanism?**
- How exactly does it work?
- What's the user journey?
- What friction was removed?

**What constraints did they work within?**
- Budget (this matters!)
- Time
- Team size
- Technical limitations

### Decoding Methods

**1. The Wayback Machine Method**
Use web.archive.org to see how successful companies evolved:
- First landing page vs. current
- Original positioning vs. now
- Early tactics they've since abandoned

**2. The Metrics Method**
Break it down into numbers:
- Estimated reach
- Viral coefficient (if applicable)
- Conversion rate signals
- Cost indicators

**3. The Recreation Method**
Actually rebuild it (even roughly):
- Forces you to understand the details
- Reveals hidden complexity
- Generates new ideas through doing

### Decode Template

```
TACTIC: [Name/Description]
SOURCE: [Where you found it]
COMPANY: [Who did it]

PROBLEM SOLVED:
[What need did this meet?]

MECHANISM:
[Step-by-step how it works]

WHY IT SPREAD:
[Virality/sharing factors]

CONSTRAINTS:
[Budget, time, team, tech limitations]

KEY INSIGHT:
[The one thing that makes this work]
```

---

## Stage 3: EXTRACT - Generic Ingredients

Turn specific tactics into reusable principles.

### Extraction Process

**Step 1: Remove brand-specific elements**
"Spotify Wrapped" becomes "Annual personalized review with shareable results"

**Step 2: Identify the core pattern**
- What category does this fall into?
- What's the underlying psychological trigger?
- What's the repeatable structure?

**Step 3: Name the pattern**
Give it a memorable name you can reference:
- "The Public Commitment Play"
- "The Visible Effort Signal"
- "The Exclusive Access Loop"

### Common Extracted Patterns

| Pattern | Description | Examples |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Progress Visualization | Show users their journey | Spotify Wrapped, LinkedIn strength |
| Social Proof Cascade | Others doing it = I should | Testimonial walls, live user counts |
| Curiosity Gap | Promise of hidden info | "The secret to...", reveal content |
| Effort Signaling | Show the work | "Hand-picked", behind-the-scenes |
| Status Upgrade | Make users feel special | VIP programs, early access |
| Scarcity Trigger | Limited availability | Countdowns, limited spots |
| Reciprocity Trap | Give first, ask later | Free tools, valuable content |
| Identity Reinforcement | "People like you..." | Tribe language, shared enemies |

### Pattern Library Format

```
PATTERN: [Name]
CATEGORY: [Lead Gen / Viral / Retention / etc.]
TRIGGER: [Psychological mechanism]

FORMULA:
[Step 1]
[Step 2]
[Step 3]

BEST FOR:
[Product types / situations]

EXAMPLES:
- [Example 1]
- [Example 2]
- [Example 3]
```

## Stage 4: APPLY - Creative Fusion

Now fuse extracted patterns with YOUR specific assets.

### Your Internal Assets (The USED Framework)

**U - Users**
- Who are your users?
- What communities are they part of?
- What do they already share?
- What would make them look good?

**S - Stories**
- Your founding story
- Customer transformation stories
- Behind-the-scenes stories
- Failure and recovery stories

**E - Employees**
- Personal brands on your team
- Unique expertise
- Networks they bring
- Their authentic voices

**D - Data/Features**
- Unique data you have access to
- Features competitors lack
- Interesting usage patterns
- Aggregate insights

### The Fusion Exercise

**Step 1: Pick a pattern from your library**
Example: "Annual personalized review with shareable results"

**Step 2: Map to your assets**
- Users: Developers using our API
- Data: API call volumes, endpoints used, uptime
- Feature: Usage dashboard already exists

**Step 3: Create the specific tactic**
"Developer Wrapped: Annual email showing each developer their API stats - total calls, favorite endpoints, uptime they experienced, rank vs other developers. Shareable card for social."

**Step 4: ICE Score it (see below)**

### Application Template

```
PATTERN APPLIED: [Pattern name]

YOUR ASSETS USED:
- Users: [How]
- Stories: [How]
- Employees: [How]
- Data/Features: [How]

THE TACTIC:
[Specific description of what you'll do]

SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE:
[Measurable outcome]

FIRST STEP:
[Immediate action to start]
```

## ICE Scoring: Prioritization Framework

After generating ideas, score them to prioritize.

### The ICE Scale

**Impact (1-10)**
How big is the potential outcome if this works?
- 10: Company-changing, 10x+ results
- 7-9: Significant, clear business impact
- 4-6: Moderate, noticeable improvement
- 1-3: Small, incremental gains

**Confidence (1-10)**
How sure are you this will work?
- 10: Proven tactic, strong evidence
- 7-9: Similar tactics worked, good signals
- 4-6: Logical hypothesis, some unknowns
- 1-3: Experimental, many assumptions

**Ease (1-10)**
How easy is this to execute?
- 10: One person, one day
- 7-9: One person, one week
- 4-6: Small team, few weeks
- 1-3: Large effort, many dependencies

### ICE Score Calculation

**ICE Score = (Impact + Confidence + Ease) / 3**

Or for more nuance:
**ICE Score = Impact × Confidence × Ease / 100**

### Scoring Template

```
| Idea | Impact | Confidence | Ease | ICE Score |
|------|--------|------------|------|-----------|
| [1]  |   /10  |     /10    | /10  |           |
| [2]  |   /10  |     /10    | /10  |           |
| [3]  |   /10  |     /10    | /10  |           |
```

### Prioritization Quadrants

**High ICE + Quick Win (do immediately)**
- Impact 7+, Ease 7+, Confidence 6+
- These are your moonshots with good odds

**High ICE + Major Project (plan carefully)**
- Impact 8+, but Ease <5
- Worth the effort, but resource-intensive

**Medium ICE + Easy (batch these)**
- Impact 4-6, Ease 7+
- Do these in downtime or delegate

**Low ICE (skip or save)**
- Total score < 15
- Not worth current focus

## The 24-Hour Execution Audit

From Moonshot Philosophy: if you can't execute it in 24 hours, simplify it.

### For Every Idea, Ask:

1. **What's the minimum viable version?**
   - What can I ship in one day?
   - What's the smallest test of this concept?

2. **What can I cut?**
   - What features aren't essential to testing?
   - What complexity can be removed?

3. **What already exists?**
   - Can I use existing tools/templates?
   - Who's already done the hard part?

4. **What's the first domino?**
   - What single action starts momentum?
   - What can I do in the next 30 minutes?

### The 24-Hour Versions

| Full Idea | 24-Hour Version |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Build an interactive calculator | Create spreadsheet, share link |
| Launch podcast series | Record one conversation, post on LinkedIn |
| Create customer community | Start Slack channel with 10 best customers |
| Write comprehensive guide | Write thread of top 5 tips |
| Host conference | Host 1-hour Zoom with 3 speakers |
