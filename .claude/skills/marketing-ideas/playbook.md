## Leads & Conversions (12 Tactics)

### 1. The Waitlist Upgrade
**One-liner:** Turn your signup into a curiosity machine
**How it works:** Instead of immediate access, create a waitlist with position tracking. Show people their spot (#4,521) and let them jump the line by sharing. Creates urgency and viral loops.
**Examples:** Robinhood's referral waitlist, Superhuman's exclusive access
**Best for:** Product launches, beta releases, new features
**Psychology:** Scarcity + progress = irresistible

### 2. The Curiosity Gap Headline
**One-liner:** Tell them what they'll learn, not what you'll teach
**How it works:** Headlines that create information gaps the brain needs to close. "The pricing mistake costing you 23% of revenue" beats "How to optimize pricing."
**Examples:** Upworthy, BuzzFeed, most viral content
**Best for:** Blog posts, emails, landing pages
**Psychology:** The brain treats unresolved curiosity like an open wound

### 3. Baby Reindeer Emails
**One-liner:** Cold emails that look like accidents
**How it works:** Write cold outreach that appears casual, like you're forwarding to a colleague. "Hey, thought you'd find this useful - we helped [similar company] do X." No formal pitch.
**Examples:** "Fwd: quick thought" subject lines, minimal formatting
**Best for:** B2B outreach, partnership requests
**Psychology:** Pattern interrupt - looks like internal email, not marketing

### 4. The Brute-Force Gift
**One-liner:** Do the work before asking for the meeting
**How it works:** Create something valuable FOR the prospect (audit, mockup, analysis) and send it as a gift. No ask attached. Follow up only after they engage.
**Examples:** Free website audit, custom video walkthrough, competitor analysis
**Best for:** High-value prospects, enterprise sales
**Psychology:** Reciprocity is strongest when unexpected

### 5. Hidden Coupons
**One-liner:** Easter eggs that spread through word of mouth
**How it works:** Hide discount codes in unexpected places - your 404 page, footer, support docs. Let customers discover and share them.
**Examples:** Websites with secret URLs, "sorry" pages with coupons
**Best for:** E-commerce, SaaS with trials
**Psychology:** Discovery feels like winning; winners want to share

### 6. Decoy Pricing
**One-liner:** Add an option you don't want them to pick
**How it works:** Add a third pricing tier that makes your target tier look like the obvious choice. The decoy exists only to make comparison easier.
**Examples:** The Economist's famous print+digital bundle, movie theater popcorn
**Best for:** Pricing pages, subscription tiers
**Psychology:** Relative comparison overrides absolute evaluation

### 7. The Reverse Landing Page
**One-liner:** Show them the result before the pitch
**How it works:** Instead of "here's what we do," show them what they'll have after. Lead with the output, outcome, or transformation.
**Examples:** Canva showing finished designs, Grammarly showing corrected text
**Best for:** Tools, services, any product with visible outcomes
**Psychology:** The brain wants to close the gap between current state and shown future

### 8. The Calculator Lead Magnet
**One-liner:** Let them calculate their own pain
**How it works:** Build an interactive calculator that quantifies the problem you solve. "How much are you losing to [problem]?" They input data, get personalized results.
**Examples:** HubSpot's Website Grader, ROI calculators, savings estimators
**Best for:** B2B, financial services, productivity tools
**Psychology:** Self-generated data is more persuasive than your claims

### 9. The Product Hunt DM Protocol
**One-liner:** Build relationships before you need them
**How it works:** Spend 8 weeks before launch genuinely engaging with Product Hunt makers. Upvote, comment thoughtfully, send DMs congratulating them. When you launch, they reciprocate.
**Examples:** Successful PH launches with 500+ upvotes from engaged community
**Best for:** Product launches, developer tools, startups
**Psychology:** Reciprocity + relationship = guaranteed support

### 10. The Phone Hotline Demo
**One-liner:** Make your demo callable
**How it works:** Set up a phone number people can call to experience your product. The call IS the demo. No friction, immediate experience.
**Examples:** Bland AI's billboard with phone number (5% conversion), demo hotlines
**Best for:** Voice AI, phone services, anything auditory
**Psychology:** Novelty + immediate gratification = high conversion

### 11. The Micro-Commitment Funnel
**One-liner:** Get small yeses before the big ask
**How it works:** Break your conversion path into tiny, easy steps. Quiz → Result → Email → Free tool → Paid. Each yes makes the next easier.
**Examples:** Typeform quizzes, personality tests leading to products
**Best for:** Complex purchases, high-consideration products
**Psychology:** Consistency principle - we honor our commitments

### 12. The Exit Intent Pivot
**One-liner:** Different ask for leaving visitors
**How it works:** When someone's about to leave, don't repeat your main CTA. Offer something different: content, tool, discount. Match the exit intent.
**Examples:** "Not ready to buy? Get our free guide instead"
**Best for:** E-commerce, SaaS, any site with bounce issues
**Psychology:** Rejection of one thing doesn't mean rejection of everything

## Buzz & Virality (15 Tactics)

### 13. The Impossible Feature Announcement
**One-liner:** Promise the ridiculous to spark debate
**How it works:** Announce a feature that sounds impossible or absurd. Even if partially joking, it creates discussion, shares, and memorability.
**Examples:** "Meeting transcription in 47 languages including Klingon"
**Best for:** Feature launches, product updates, tech products
**Psychology:** Absurdity is shareable; debate drives engagement

### 14. The Accidental Email
**One-liner:** Curiosity through apparent mistakes
**How it works:** Send an email that looks like it went to the wrong person, or tease an "accidental" leak. Follow up with the real reveal.
**Examples:** "Oops, wrong list - but since you're here..." subject lines
**Best for:** Product teasers, announcements, engagement campaigns
**Psychology:** Accidents feel authentic; curiosity demands resolution

### 15. Newsjacking
**One-liner:** Ride someone else's wave
**How it works:** When big news breaks in your industry, be FIRST with thoughtful commentary, a relevant angle, or useful content. Speed matters more than perfection.
**Examples:** HubSpot on marketing news, tech companies on platform updates
**Best for:** Blog posts, social media, email newsletters
**Psychology:** Existing attention is easier to capture than create

### 16. The Mini-Game Launch
**One-liner:** Gamify your announcement
**How it works:** Turn your launch into a playable experience. Wordle-style puzzles, interactive reveals, or games that demonstrate your product.
**Examples:** Google Doodle games, interactive product revealers
**Best for:** Consumer products, developer tools, creative brands
**Psychology:** Play is irresistible; completion drives sharing

### 17. The Fake Job Title Blast
**One-liner:** Hijack LinkedIn's job change algorithm
**How it works:** Have your entire team change their LinkedIn titles to something attention-grabbing and launch-related. 50 people = 50 notifications to their networks.
**Examples:** "Chief AI Whisperer" for AI launches, themed titles for events
**Best for:** Product launches, company announcements, hiring pushes
**Psychology:** Job changes get organic reach; unusual titles get clicks

### 18. The Billboard Email (Loops Strategy)
**One-liner:** Turn your email into physical advertising
**How it works:** Screenshot a well-designed email newsletter and buy cheap billboard space or physical ads showing it. "As seen in your inbox" becomes real-world proof.
**Examples:** Loops' email-to-billboard strategy
**Best for:** Email products, newsletters, B2B tools
**Psychology:** Physical presence validates digital existence

### 19. Word of Sight
**One-liner:** Design for screenshots
**How it works:** Create UI moments, dashboards, or results screens specifically designed to be screenshotted and shared. Make the visual tell the story.
**Examples:** Spotify Wrapped, GitHub contribution graphs, fitness app achievements
**Best for:** Consumer apps, data products, achievement-based features
**Psychology:** Visual proof > verbal claims; sharing = identity signaling

### 20. The Visible Labor Post
**One-liner:** Show the work, not just the result
**How it works:** Document your process publicly. Share the messy middle, the iterations, the failures. People value effort they can see.
**Examples:** Indie hackers sharing build logs, "ship with me" threads
**Best for:** Founders, creators, any product with a story
**Psychology:** Effort heuristic - visible work = perceived value

### 21. The Chicken Game
**One-liner:** Challenge them to NOT click
**How it works:** Dare your audience to resist. "Most people can't finish this video" or "Don't click unless you're ready." Reverse psychology works.
**Examples:** Clickbait that calls itself out, challenge-style CTAs
**Best for:** Content marketing, social media, ads
**Psychology:** Reactance - we want what we're told we can't have

### 22. Event Hijacking
**One-liner:** Be where the attention is (without paying for it)
**How it works:** Show up near major industry events without official sponsorship. Host a counter-party, set up nearby, or create experience that pulls attendees.
**Examples:** Startups hosting parties opposite conference venues
**Best for:** Industry events, conferences, trade shows
**Psychology:** Attention clusters can be redirected

### 23. The Niche Landing Page
**One-liner:** "The first [product] for [tiny audience]"
**How it works:** Create absurdly specific landing pages. "The first CRM for left-handed dentists" - specificity = virality + SEO long-tail wins.
**Examples:** Niche product pages, targeted industry variants
**Best for:** Horizontal products, SaaS, any tool with broad use cases
**Psychology:** Specificity feels personal; absurdity is shareable

### 24. The Controversy Stake
**One-liner:** Take a position your competitors won't
**How it works:** Make a statement that's true but uncomfortable. Call out industry BS, take the unpopular-but-correct stance. Polarization creates loyalty.
**Examples:** Basecamp on productivity culture, brands with strong opinions
**Best for:** Brand building, thought leadership, differentiation
**Psychology:** Strong opinions attract strong fans

### 25. The Launch Day Countdown
**One-liner:** Build anticipation with deadlines
**How it works:** Create a public countdown to launch. Share progress updates, tease features, build a narrative. The deadline creates urgency.
**Examples:** Apple keynote countdowns, product launch timers
**Best for:** Major launches, version releases, events
**Psychology:** Deadlines manufacture attention

### 26. The Response Time Flex
**One-liner:** Make your speed part of the marketing
**How it works:** Publicly commit to and display extreme response times. "Average reply: 4 minutes" becomes a feature.
**Examples:** Support response time badges, live chat timers
**Best for:** Service businesses, support-heavy products
**Psychology:** Speed signals care; transparency builds trust

### 27. The UGC Trigger
**One-liner:** Design for user-generated content
**How it works:** Build specific moments or features designed to be captured and shared by users. Make it easy, make it shareable, make them look good.
**Examples:** Photo-worthy packaging, shareable results screens
**Best for:** Consumer products, experiences, apps with outputs
**Psychology:** People share what makes them look good

---

## Customer Sharing (8 Tactics)

### 28. The Status Symbol
**One-liner:** Make using your product a flex
**How it works:** Create elements that signal sophistication, early adoption, or insider status. Limited badges, exclusive features, or visible markers.
**Examples:** Superhuman's badge, limited edition anything
**Best for:** Premium products, communities, subscription services
**Psychology:** Social status drives sharing more than quality

### 29. The Customer Spotlight
**One-liner:** Make heroes of your users
**How it works:** Feature customers prominently - case studies, social mentions, blog features. Make them look successful, not just satisfied.
**Examples:** Customer story features, "power user" highlights
**Best for:** B2B, communities, any product with success stories
**Psychology:** Being featured = validation + obligation to share

### 30. The Shareable Result
**One-liner:** Make outcomes screenshot-worthy
**How it works:** Design your product's outputs to be visually appealing and context-complete when shared. Include branding subtly.
**Examples:** Canva exports, Spotify Wrapped, fitness achievements
**Best for:** Tools with outputs, analytics products, creative tools
**Psychology:** Results prove value; screenshots are free ads

### 31. The Progress Celebration
**One-liner:** Make milestones feel like achievements
**How it works:** Recognize and celebrate user milestones. "You've completed 100 tasks!" with shareable graphics and social prompts.
**Examples:** Duolingo streaks, LinkedIn profile strength
**Best for:** Apps with progress, learning platforms, productivity tools
**Psychology:** Achievement + social proof = sharing behavior

### 32. The Referral Upgrade
**One-liner:** Better rewards for givers, not just getters
**How it works:** Make the referrer feel generous, not salesy. "Give your friend 50% off" > "Get $10 for referrals." Focus on their giving.
**Examples:** Referral programs that lead with recipient benefit
**Best for:** Any product with referral programs
**Psychology:** Generosity > greed as sharing motivation

### 33. The Team Feature
**One-liner:** Build for groups, market to individuals
**How it works:** Create features that require or benefit from bringing in others. The product grows through use, not just marketing.
**Examples:** Slack channels, Notion workspaces, collaborative tools
**Best for:** Collaboration tools, team products
**Psychology:** Network effects + social pressure = organic growth

### 34. The Success Template
**One-liner:** Give them the words to share
**How it works:** Provide pre-written templates for sharing success. "I just [achieved X] using [product]! Here's how:" Make sharing frictionless.
**Examples:** Pre-filled share templates, social share buttons with copy
**Best for:** Any product with user achievements
**Psychology:** Reduced friction = increased action

### 35. The Advocate Program
**One-liner:** Formalize your superfans
**How it works:** Create an official program for your best customers. Exclusive access, early features, direct line to founders. Make them insiders.
**Examples:** Beta programs, ambassador programs, advisory boards
**Best for:** Products with passionate users
**Psychology:** Insider status = ownership = advocacy

## Competitive Edge (6 Tactics)

### 36. Google Dorking for Leads
**One-liner:** Find competitor customers with search operators
**How it works:** Use advanced Google searches to find people discussing competitors, complaining, or seeking alternatives. Target with precision.
**Examples:** `"[competitor] sucks" site:reddit.com`, `"looking for [competitor] alternative"`
**Best for:** B2B, SaaS, any market with active discussions
**Psychology:** Dissatisfied customers are the warmest leads

### 37. Ad Library Intelligence
**One-liner:** Steal your competitors' winning ads
**How it works:** Use Facebook Ad Library and similar tools to see exactly what ads competitors are running, how long they've run (longer = working), and their messaging.
**Examples:** Reviewing competitor ad creative and copy patterns
**Best for:** Paid marketing, creative development
**Psychology:** Longevity = effectiveness; imitate what works

### 38. The Comparison Page
**One-liner:** Control the narrative on comparisons
**How it works:** Create "[Your Product] vs [Competitor]" pages before others do. Be honest but frame comparisons favorably. Own the SEO.
**Examples:** Every SaaS comparison page
**Best for:** Products with direct competitors
**Psychology:** The framer wins; first mover in comparisons

### 39. Category Creation
**One-liner:** Don't compete - redefine
**How it works:** Instead of claiming to be the best X, create a new category where you're the only player. Define it, name it, own it.
**Examples:** Drift creating "conversational marketing"
**Best for:** Innovative products, crowded markets
**Psychology:** Being first > being better

### 40. The Feature Parity Decoy
**One-liner:** Announce what competitors don't have
**How it works:** Prominently feature capabilities your competitors lack. Make their absence obvious through your presence.
**Examples:** Feature comparison tables, "only we have" callouts
**Best for:** Product marketing, landing pages
**Psychology:** Highlighted gaps create doubt

### 41. The Anti-Positioning
**One-liner:** Define yourself by what you're not
**How it works:** Explicitly call out what you reject. "Unlike [competitor approach], we believe..." Strong opinions attract ideal customers.
**Examples:** Basecamp's "It doesn't have to be crazy at work"
**Best for:** Brand positioning, manifesto content
**Psychology:** Enemies unite tribes faster than features

---

## Retention & Engagement (8 Tactics)

### 42. The Surprise Upgrade
**One-liner:** Give more than expected
**How it works:** Randomly upgrade customers, extend trials, or unlock features without being asked. Surprise generosity creates loyalty.
**Examples:** Free storage upgrades, extended trials, bonus features
**Best for:** SaaS, subscription products
**Psychology:** Unexpected positive experiences are memorable

### 43. The Win-Back Sequence
**One-liner:** Personalized recovery, not generic blasts
**How it works:** When customers leave, send personalized outreach about what's changed, what they're missing, or genuine "we miss you" messages.
**Examples:** Tailored re-engagement emails, "here's what's new" updates
**Best for:** Subscription products, SaaS
**Psychology:** Personal attention > automated messages

### 44. The Milestone Gift
**One-liner:** Celebrate customers' achievements
**How it works:** Track customer success milestones and celebrate them - congratulation messages, badges, even physical gifts for big moments.
**Examples:** Anniversary emails, usage milestone celebrations
**Best for:** Any product with trackable usage
**Psychology:** Recognition creates emotional bonds

### 45. The Community Loop
**One-liner:** Let customers help each other
**How it works:** Build spaces where customers can connect, share tips, and solve problems together. Community reduces support load and increases retention.
**Examples:** Slack communities, forums, Discord servers
**Best for:** Products with learning curves or use cases to share
**Psychology:** Community creates switching costs

### 46. The Feedback Feature
**One-liner:** Build what they ask for, publicly
**How it works:** Create a public roadmap where customers can vote on features. Build voted features and credit the requesters.
**Examples:** Canny, public roadmaps, "you asked, we built" updates
**Best for:** Product-led companies, SaaS
**Psychology:** Participation = ownership = retention

### 47. The Re-Engagement Hook
**One-liner:** Give them a reason to come back
**How it works:** Create regular events, new content, or time-sensitive features that pull inactive users back. Weekly digests, new data, fresh challenges.
**Examples:** Spotify's Monday playlists, weekly reports
**Best for:** Apps with ongoing usage
**Psychology:** Habits need triggers

### 48. The Power User Track
**One-liner:** Advanced path for your best users
**How it works:** Create exclusive features, advanced tutorials, or VIP access for high-engagement users. Make power user status aspirational.

**Best for:** Products with depth, learning platforms
**Psychology:** Status ladders drive continued engagement

### 49. The Exit Interview
**One-liner:** Learn from churners, win some back

**Examples:** Cancellation surveys with human follow-up
**Best for:** Subscription products, SaaS
**Psychology:** Being heard matters; problems can be solved

## Events & Physical (5 Tactics)

### 50. The Anti-Booth Booth
**One-liner:** Stand out by standing down
**How it works:** Instead of standard booth setup, create an experience. Couches, coffee, games, photo ops - anything but brochures and demos.
**Examples:** Interactive experiences, rest areas, entertainment
**Best for:** Trade shows, conferences
**Psychology:** Relief from sales pressure = positive association

### 51. The Hallway Hustle
**One-liner:** The real event is between sessions
**How it works:** Focus on hallway conversations, not scheduled sessions. Strategic positioning, conversation starters, memorable swag.
**Examples:** Founders walking conference hallways, strategic lunch tables
**Best for:** Industry events, networking conferences
**Psychology:** Informal > formal for relationship building

### 52. The Pre-Event List
**One-liner:** Know who's coming, reach out first
**How it works:** Get attendee lists before events. Send personalized outreach to priority contacts. Schedule meetings before the event starts.
**Examples:** LinkedIn outreach to registered attendees
**Best for:** Industry events, conferences
**Psychology:** Pre-warmed connections > cold intros

### 53. The Counter-Event
**One-liner:** Host your own thing
**How it works:** Instead of sponsoring expensive booths, host your own event nearby. Dinners, happy hours, workshops - smaller but more intimate.
**Examples:** Startup dinners during SaaStr, unofficial after-parties
**Best for:** Any industry event
**Psychology:** Intimate settings build stronger relationships

### 54. The Physical Pattern Interrupt
**One-liner:** Be weird in person
**How it works:** Create memorable physical moments - unusual swag, unexpected experiences, or environmental surprises that people photograph and share.
**Examples:** Oversized props, interactive installations, surprise performances
**Best for:** Events, physical retail, office visits
**Psychology:** Physical unusualness = memorable = shareable

---

## Future-Proofing & AI-Resistant (8 Tactics)

### 55. The Personal Brand Moat
**One-liner:** People trust people, not algorithms
**How it works:** Invest in founder/team personal brands. Humans with opinions, stories, and presence can't be replicated by AI.
**Examples:** Founder-led companies, thought leader positioning
**Best for:** Any company, especially in crowded markets
**Psychology:** Parasocial relationships with humans > brands

### 56. The Owned Community
**One-liner:** Build your own distribution
**How it works:** Create communities you own - email lists, Discord servers, private groups. Don't rent attention on platforms that can change.
**Examples:** Newsletter communities, private Slack groups
**Best for:** Any business
**Psychology:** Owned > rented distribution

### 57. The Human Touch Point
**One-liner:** Insert humans where AI can't go
**How it works:** Identify moments in customer journey where human interaction creates disproportionate value. Double down there.
**Examples:** Personal onboarding calls, handwritten notes, video messages
**Best for:** High-value customers, premium products
**Psychology:** Human attention is the new luxury

### 58. The Relationship-First Outreach
**One-liner:** Long-term relationships > short-term conversions
**How it works:** Build genuine relationships with prospects over time. Engage with their content, help without asking, be a person first.
**Examples:** Consistent social engagement, helpful DMs, genuine networking
**Best for:** B2B, high-value sales
**Psychology:** Trust compounds; transactions don't

### 59. The Expertise Moat
**One-liner:** Know things AI doesn't
**How it works:** Develop and share deep, proprietary expertise. Original research, unique data, insider knowledge that can't be scraped.
**Examples:** Original research reports, proprietary benchmarks
**Best for:** B2B, consultancies, expert-led companies
**Psychology:** Unique knowledge = unique value

### 60. The Physical Product Anchor
**One-liner:** Make something you can hold
**How it works:** Create physical artifacts of your digital product. Books, cards, prints, tools - tangible items that exist in the real world.
**Examples:** Brand merch, physical guides, printed reports
**Best for:** Digital products seeking credibility
**Psychology:** Physical = real; digital = ephemeral

### 61. The Live Experience
**One-liner:** Create unreplicable moments
**How it works:** Host live events, workshops, or experiences. Real-time, in-person (or live virtual) moments that AI can't replace.
**Examples:** Live workshops, office hours, meetups
**Best for:** Educational products, communities
**Psychology:** Presence creates connection

### 62. The Story Advantage
**One-liner:** Your story is unique; use it
**How it works:** Lean into the unique story of how and why your company exists. Origin stories, struggles, victories - these can't be faked.
**Examples:** Founder story content, "why we built this" narratives
**Best for:** Any company with a genuine story
**Psychology:** Stories create emotional bonds

## Engineering-as-Marketing (8 Tactics)

### 63. The Free Tool Play
**One-liner:** Build a useful tool, capture leads
**How it works:** Create a free, useful tool related to your product. It attracts your target audience and naturally leads to your paid product.
**Examples:** HubSpot's Website Grader, CoSchedule's Headline Analyzer
**Best for:** SaaS, marketing tools, B2B
**Psychology:** Utility creates trust; trust enables sales

### 64. The Data Product
**One-liner:** Turn your data into marketing
**How it works:** Create reports, benchmarks, or insights from your aggregate data. Original data gets press, backlinks, and establishes authority.
**Examples:** State of [Industry] reports, benchmark studies
**Best for:** Products with interesting aggregate data
**Psychology:** Original data = earned media

### 65. The Widget Strategy
**One-liner:** Embed yourself in other sites
**How it works:** Create embeddable widgets that add value to other websites while driving awareness and backlinks to yours.
**Examples:** Social share widgets, calculators, badges
**Best for:** Tools with embeddable outputs
**Psychology:** Distribution through utility

### 66. The API as Marketing
**One-liner:** Let developers be your marketers
**How it works:** Create a robust, well-documented API that developers love to build on. Developer adoption = organic distribution.
**Examples:** Stripe, Twilio - developer experience as competitive advantage
**Best for:** Technical products, platforms
**Psychology:** Developer love spreads through communities

### 67. The Template Library
**One-liner:** Ready-to-use = more users
**How it works:** Create extensive template libraries for your product. Reduce friction to value and increase use cases.
**Examples:** Notion templates, Airtable bases, Figma files
**Best for:** Flexible tools, design software
**Psychology:** Templates = immediate value

### 68. The Integration Play
**One-liner:** Be where your users already are
**How it works:** Build integrations with popular tools your users already use. Reduce friction and increase discovery.
**Examples:** Zapier integrations, Slack apps
**Best for:** SaaS, productivity tools
**Psychology:** Integration = reduced switching costs

### 69. The Open Source Component
**One-liner:** Give away to gain
**How it works:** Open source a useful component or library. Developers discover and trust you through your free contribution.
**Examples:** Companies with popular open source projects
**Best for:** Technical products, developer tools
**Psychology:** Generosity builds reputation

### 70. The Interactive Demo
**One-liner:** Let them play, not watch

**Examples:** No-signup product demos, interactive walkthroughs
**Best for:** SaaS, any product with clear value demonstration
**Psychology:** Experience > explanation

---

## Reddit Marketing (4 Tactics)

### 71. The Reddit Loophole
**One-liner:** Post results without explaining your brand
**How it works:** Reddit bans direct promotion instantly. But posting about RESULTS (income screenshots, transformations, lifestyle flexes) where your brand "happens to be visible" breaks no rules. The post is about THEM (their earnings, their story), not you. Thousands then Google your brand name.
**Examples:** Cluely's payment screenshot showing huge earnings - no explanation of what Cluely does. "I quit my job thanks to [brand]" posts.
**Best for:** Products with visible results, income-generating tools, transformation products
**Psychology:** Curiosity gap + social proof. When people see results without explanation, they MUST know what the brand does.

### 72. The Reddit Native Ad Format
**One-liner:** Make your ads look like confessions
**How it works:** Reddit users ignore anything that looks like an ad. But they ALWAYS stop for juicy confessions. Use TIFU (Today I F*cked Up) or AITAH (Am I The A**hole) format for your paid ads. Screenshot-style creative that looks like organic content.
**Examples:** Ramp used TIFU format: "TIFU by not using expense software..." Torq used AITAH format for security stories.
**Best for:** Any product with a relatable problem/mistake story
**Psychology:** Confession format triggers curiosity and feels authentic, not corporate.

### 73. The Stealth Brand Flex
**One-liner:** Let users do your promotion
**How it works:** Create shareable moments (earnings dashboards, achievement screens, results) that users WANT to screenshot and share on Reddit. Your brand is visible but they're posting about themselves.
**Examples:** Payment/earnings screens, before/after transformations, "Day 30 results" posts
**Best for:** Fintech, fitness, productivity, any product with measurable outcomes
**Psychology:** People share wins. If your brand is in their win screenshot, you get free distribution.

### 74. The Platform Early Mover
**One-liner:** Move fast on new ad platforms
**How it works:** Every ad platform follows the same curve: launches cheap → early adopters crush it → everyone catches on → costs spike. When new platforms open ads (ChatGPT ads launching 2026), move FAST. The window for early movers is always shorter than you think.
**Examples:** Early Facebook ads, early TikTok ads, early podcast ads
**Best for:** Any paid acquisition strategy
**Psychology:** Arbitrage windows close quickly. First movers get the lowest CAC.

## Crisis & Competitor Response (3 Tactics)

### 75. The Crisis Communication Template
**One-liner:** Own it, fix it, prove it
**How it works:** When things go wrong: (1) Acknowledge immediately with short sentences, (2) Take real responsibility - "You expect more from us", (3) Announce concrete action - credits, fixes, timeline. No corporate speak, no blame-shifting.
**Examples:** Verizon's outage response: acknowledged → took responsibility → announced $20 credits
**Best for:** Any crisis, outage, mistake, or public failure
**Psychology:** Owning mistakes builds more trust than perfection. People forgive companies that respond well.

### 76. The Competitor Crisis Hero
**One-liner:** Help when they fail, don't sell
**How it works:** When your competitor has a crisis, DON'T run sales ads. Instead, HELP their customers. Offer free service, extended trials, or genuine assistance. Being a hero beats being opportunistic.
**Examples:** IKEA charges LESS for umbrellas when it rains. T-Mobile could have offered Verizon customers a free month instead of running sales ads.
**Best for:** Any competitive situation where rival has public failure
**Psychology:** Generosity in someone's moment of need creates stories people tell. Sales pitches during crises create resentment.

### 77. The Anti-Opportunistic Play
**One-liner:** Silence beats sleaze
**How it works:** Sometimes the best move during a competitor's crisis is to do nothing publicly. Let them fail without piling on. Your restraint shows class. Customers notice who DIDN'T kick them while down.
**Examples:** Brands that stayed quiet during competitor outages while others looked desperate
**Best for:** When competitor crisis is severe and customers are already angry
**Psychology:** Restraint signals confidence. Piling on signals desperation.
