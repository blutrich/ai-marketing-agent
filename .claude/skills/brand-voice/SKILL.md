## The BASE44 Voice Framework

```
B - Be specific (numbers, names, dates)

4 - 4th grade reading level (clarity)
4 - 4 truths > 40 features (focus)
```

## Voice Rules

### DO THIS:
| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Specific numbers | "$47,329 in 3 months" |
| Direct instruction | "Here's exactly how" |
| Honest limitations | "This won't work if..." |
| Personal experience | "I was wrong about X" |
| Concise | "3 steps. That's it." |

### NOT THIS:
| Anti-Pattern | Example |
|--------------|---------|
| Vague claims | "significant revenue growth" |
| Hedging | "There are several ways to" |
| Corporate neutral | "Perspectives on X vary" |
| Generic disclaimers | "Results may vary" |
| Overcomplication | "A comprehensive approach" |

## Kill List (NEVER Use These Words)

```
- delve, dive into, dive deep
- comprehensive, robust, streamline
- leverage, synergy, paradigm
- in today's world, in this day and age
- cutting-edge, state-of-the-art
- arguably, essentially, basically
- it goes without saying
- at the end of the day
- moving forward, going forward
- landscape, ecosystem
- empower, enable, unlock
- seamless, frictionless
- best-in-class, world-class
- game-changer, disruptive
```

## Add List (Use Often)

```
- Specific numbers: "2,847 users", "37 minutes", "$12,400"
- Named examples: "Like when Sarah at Acme..."
- Time markers: "Last Tuesday", "In March 2024"
- Honest limitations: "This won't work if..."
- Direct opinions: "I think X is wrong"
- Personal stories: "I learned this when..."
- Contractions: "don't", "won't", "here's"
- Questions to reader: "Sound familiar?"
```

## Writing Process

1. **Write like you talk** - Read it out loud. If it sounds weird, rewrite it.
2. **Use "you" and "I"** - Never "one" or passive voice
3. **Short sentences. Then a longer one to breathe. Then land the point.**
4. **Start with the most interesting thing** - Not background

### Specificity Rules:
- Replace every vague word with a specific one
- Use real numbers, even if estimated ("about 3,400" not "thousands")
- Name names when possible (tools, companies, people)
- Give timelines ("in 2 weeks" not "quickly")

### Honesty Rules:
- Acknowledge what you don't know
- Say when something won't work for everyone
- Share failures, not just wins
- Have opinions - don't hedge everything

### Structure Rules:
- One idea per paragraph
- Bullet points for lists of 3+ items
- Bold the key takeaway in longer sections
- End with a clear next step

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing, verify:

**Voice Check:**
- [ ] Would I say this out loud to a smart friend?
- [ ] Zero words from the Kill List?
- [ ] At least 3 specific numbers/names/dates?
- [ ] Reads naturally when spoken aloud?

**Clarity Check:**
- [ ] Could a smart 14-year-old understand this?
- [ ] Is the main point in the first 2 sentences?
- [ ] Are paragraphs under 4 sentences?
- [ ] Is there a clear takeaway?

**Trust Check:**
- [ ] Did I acknowledge any limitations?
- [ ] Did I share an opinion (not just facts)?
- [ ] Does it sound like a real person?
- [ ] Would I be proud to put my name on this?

## Examples

### GOOD Example:
```
I spent $12,000 on AI tools last year.

$9,200 of that was wasted.

Here are the 4 tools that actually stuck:
1. Claude for writing (replaced 3 other tools)
2. Cursor for coding (I'm not a developer, but now I build things)
3. Perplexity for research (killed my 6 Chrome tabs habit)
4. Granola for meeting notes (finally, notes I actually use)

The other 23 tools I tried? Gone.

The lesson: Start with one tool. Use it for 30 days. Then add another.

Tool-hopping is expensive.
```

**Why it works:**
- Specific numbers ($12,000, $9,200, 4 tools, 23 tools, 30 days)
- Personal experience ("I spent", "I'm not a developer")
- Honest about failures ($9,200 wasted, 23 tools gone)
- Clear takeaway (Start with one tool)
- Conversational rhythm

### BAD Example:
```
In today's rapidly evolving technological landscape, businesses must carefully consider their AI tool investments. A comprehensive approach to AI adoption involves evaluating multiple solutions to find the optimal fit for your organization's unique needs. By leveraging the right tools, companies can streamline their workflows and drive meaningful results.
```

**Why it fails:**
- "In today's" opener (Kill List)
- "Comprehensive", "leverage", "streamline" (Kill List)
- Zero specific numbers
- No personality or personal experience
- No clear takeaway
- Sounds like everyone else
